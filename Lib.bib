	abstract     = {In this article, we propose an optimal method referred to as SPlit for splitting a dataset into training and testing sets. SPlit is based on the method of support points (SP), which was initially developed for finding the optimal representative points of a continuous distribution. We adapt SP for subsampling from a dataset using a sequential nearest neighbor algorithm. We also extend SP to deal with categorical variables so that SPlit can be applied to both regression and classification problems. The implementation of SPlit on real datasets shows substantial improvement in the worst-case testing performance for several modeling methods compared to the commonly used random splitting procedure.

	abstract     = {The way that available data are divided into training, testing, and validation subsets can have a significant influence on the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN). Despite numerous studies, no systematic approach has been developed for the optimal division of data for ANN models. This paper presents two methodologies for dividing data into representative subsets, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a self-organizing map (SOM). These two methods are compared with the conventional approach commonly used in the literature, which involves an arbitrary division of the data. A case study is presented in which ANN models developed using each data division technique are used to forecast salinity in the River Murray at Murray Bridge (South Australia) 14 days in advance. When tested on a validation data set from July 1992 to March 1998, the models developed using the GA and SOM data division techniques resulted in a reduction in RMS error of 24.2{\%} and 9.9{\%}, respectively, over the conventional data division method. It was found that a SOM could be used to diagnose why an ANN model has performed poorly, given that the poor performance is primarily related to the data themselves and not the choice of the ANN's parameters or architecture.},

	abstract     = {An automated and reliable processing of bubbly flow images is highly needed to analyse large data sets of comprehensive experimental series. A particular difficulty arises due to overlapping bubble projections in recorded images, which highly complicates the identification of individual bubbles. Recent approaches focus on the use of deep learning algorithms for this task and have already proven the high potential of such techniques. The main difficulties are the capability to handle different image conditions, higher gas volume fractions and a proper reconstruction of the hidden segment of a partly occluded bubble. In the present work, we try to tackle these points by testing three different methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) for the two former and two individual approaches that can be used subsequently to address the latter. Our focus is hereby on spherical, ellipsoidal and wobbling bubbles, which are typically encountered in air-water bubbly flows. To validate our methodology, we created test data sets with synthetic images that further demonstrate the capabilities as well as limitations of our combined approach. The generated data, code and trained models are made accessible to facilitate the use as well as further developments in the research field of bubble recognition in experimental images.}
